Subscription Products often are the main source of revenue for companies across all industries.These products can come in the form of a 'one size fits all' overcompassing subscription, or in multi-level memberships. Regardless of how their memberships, or what industry they are in,
companies almost always try to minimize customer churn(a.k.a subscription cancellations). To retain their customers, these companies first need to identify behavioural patterns that
act as catalyst in disengagement with the product.
The objective of this model is to predict which user are likely to churn, so that the company can focus on re-engaging these users with the product. 
These efforts can be email remainders about the benifits of the product, especially focusing on features that are new or that the user has shown to value.
